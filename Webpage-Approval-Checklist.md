Use the following checklist to make sure that a page or post meets all basic guidelines before publishing to the public.

## __ Does the page use meaningful content hierachy?

All content should use headings and subheadings properly to break up information.

## __ Are headings and subheadings concise and to the point?

Headings and subheadings are used to scan information. Therefore, they should be simple and descriptive.

## __ Do all images used have a very specific purpose?

No images should just used for decoration or to "create interest" or "entertain readers."
    
## __ Do all images have Alt tags?

Alt tags should describe the function that the image is playing on the page instead of describing the image itself.
    
## __ Using Tags and Categories

Using the Wordpress ability to tage and categorize posts and pages allow us to group related pages together and make pages eaiser to search for.
    
## __ Is there a clear message and course of action for the reader?

What do we want the reader to take away from this page? This should be kept down to a sentence at most as that is how much the reader will remember.
    
## __ Do audio and video media have easily accessible transcripts?

No information should be presented in a format that not all people can access.
    
## __ Is critical content presented first and foremost?

Most people don't read a whole webpage. If you want them to see something, say it first.

## __ Is emphasis used sparingly?

When emphasis (bold, italics, etc.) is used too frequently, text becomes hard to read and emphasis loses all meaning. Emphasize words and phrases only and do so with caution.

## __ Is text content chunked into small paragraphs?

Smaller groupings of textual information is easier for people to read and remember.
    
## __ Is text content easy to read and understand in a hurry?

To be able to be understood by the majority of our audience, text on each page has to be able to be read and understood my someone who is in a hurry. We cannot predict the level of distraction or attention that a person will have or know how well they can read at a given time, so we should reduce the challenges that we present.
        
If language needs to be presented in a specific way for legal reasons, it should be summarized in Plain Text first.

## __ Are links useful and descriptive?

Nothing is worse on a webpage than a "click here" type link. You never know where it is going by itself.

## __ Is PDF content provided in alternate, more accessible formats?

All documents should be available as RTF Documents and HTML Documents if possible.

## __ Is there an easy way to get more information regarding this topic?

There should always be a way for a reader to get more information reagrding a given topic. If contact information is available in the sidebar, this might suffice.
